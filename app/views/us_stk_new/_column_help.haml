  If you can read this text, that means you probably have JavaScript turned off.

  %br/
  This site mostly works okay if you have JavaScript turned off.
  %br/
  %br/
  One thing which will not work is pop-up-help messages.
  %br/
  %br/
  If you want to read the pop-up-help messages while you have JavaScript turned off,
  you will find them below this line.

#help4_stockticker(title="Column Help")
  %h4 Stock Ticker
  This site displays short-term predictions on about 200 different stocks.
  %br/
  %br/
  I identify a stock by its ticker also known as the stock symbol.
  %br/
  %br/
  I usually do not identify a stock by the name of its company.
  %br/

#help4_gmttimeathour0(title="Column Help")
  %h4 GMT / UTC Time at Hour 0
  This column contains GMT/UTC timestamps for each prediction-score.
  %br/
  %br/
  During winter, GMT is 5 hours ahead of EST, 8 hours ahead of PST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  During summer, GMT is 4 hours ahead of EDT, 7 hours ahead of PDT, 1 hour behind BST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  The current GMT/UTC time can be seen here:
  %a(target="t" href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl")http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl
  %br/
  %br/
  During the winter, the current time in London is identical to GMT/UTC time:

#help4_priceathour0(title="Column Help")
  %h4 Price at Hour 0
  Every five minutes, for each of the tickers, I feed the DanBot two pieces of information.
  %br/
  %br/
  I tell it the ticker's price and I tell DanBot what time it is (GMT time).
  I refer to the price as the "Price at Hour 0".
  %br/
  %br/
  If the DanBot calculates a prediction-score that I like (below -0.55 or above +0.55) I wait for 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  Then I decide to either ignore the prediction
  (usually because of a large price-move move in the last hour),
  or I follow the prediction and open a short or long position corresponding to that ticker.
  %br/
  %br/
  Usually when I want to open a short position for a ticker, I instead buy a "near-the-money" put option from the options market.
  %br/
  %br/
  %a(target="g" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=near+the+money+put+option")
    http://www.google.com/search?q=near+the+money+put+option
  %br/
  %br/
  Usually a put option exhibits the same price behavior as a short position.
  %br/
  %br/
  One problem with put options is they are often not very liquid which is evident within the spread between the bid price and the ask price.
  %br/
  %br/
  A simple rule I follow in the options market is avoid buying any option which has a spread which is more than 3% the price of the option.
  %br/
  %br/
  An example of a ticker which has nice liquid put options is SPY:
  %br/
  %a(href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=SPY+Options" target="y")http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=SPY+Options
  %br/
  %br/
  An example of a ticker which often has unattractive put options is VMW:
  %br/
  %a(href="http://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=VMW" target="y")http://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=VMW
  %br/
  %br/

#help4_danbotscoreathour0(title="Column Help")
  %h4 DanBot Score at Hour 0
  =render :partial => "column_help_danbot"

#help4_scoretype(title="Column Help")
  %h4 Score Type
  The values in this column are redundant.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the DanBot-score is less than zero, I see that as a signal to sell.
  Otherwise it is a buy signal.
  %br/

#help4_gainathour1(title="Column Help")
  %h4 Gain at Hour 1
  If the DanBot calculates a prediction-score that I like (below -0.55 or above +0.55) I wait for 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  The gain for the ticker over that 1 hour duration is displayed here.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the values here are blank either we are not at Hour 1 yet
  or the site has encountered software defects.
  These are usually noticed quickly and thus rapidly fixed.
  %br/

#help4_gmttimeathour24timetocloseposition(title="Column Help")
  %h4 GMT Time at Hour 24
  I have configured SVM so that it only looks for lucrative positions held for a duration of 24 hours.
  %br/
  %br/
  This strategy allows me to enter a clock-triggered close-order immediately after I open each postion.
  %br/
  %br/
  After I open a position (usually at Hour 1) and then I enter a clock-triggered close-order (to close the position 23 hours later at Hour 24), I can focus on other tasks.
  %br/
  %br/
  I dislike any strategy which requires me to hover near my keyboard for hours or days to ensure that my attention captures signals from a server to close positions.
