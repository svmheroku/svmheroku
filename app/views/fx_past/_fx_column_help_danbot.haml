The DanBot is predictive software I wrote and perfected during the years 2008 through 2011.

I run the DanBot on a set of servers which feed data to this website.

The DanBot relies on a machine learning algorithm called:
%a(target="w" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine")Support Vector Machine (SVM).
%br/
%br/
It is easy to find discussion about predicting attributes in time series data using SVM:

The DanBot issues prediction-scores on 11 different currency pairs every 5 minutes when the Forex market is open.
%br/
%br/
Currently the Forex market is open every hour between 9pm Sunday and 9pm Friday London time.
So, every hour the DanBot calculates 660 prediction-scores which is almost 16,000 scores per day.
%br/
%br/
If a score is between -0.55 and 0.55, then I ignore it.
%br/
%br/
If a score is greater than 0.55 on a currency pair at "Hour 0",
then the DanBot is predicting that the currency pair price will be higher at "Hour 6" which is exactly 6 hours after Hour 0.
%br/
%br/
Likewise, if a score is less than -0.55 on a currency pair at Hour 0,
then the DanBot is predicting that the currency pair price will be lower after 6 hours.
%br/
%br/
I ignore the vast majority of scores
(because they are usually between -0.55 and 0.55).
%br/
%br/
In a typical week, about 300 scores will catch my attention.
%br/
%br/
Once I see a score that I like, I wait until the score is 1 hour old (I call this point in time: "Hour 1").
%br/
%br/
Then I check the price of the currency pair.
If the price has moved less than 0.1% during that 1 hour,
I will open a position in that currency pair for 5 hours and then I will close it at Hour 6.
