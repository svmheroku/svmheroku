  h4#b2011_0713 2011-07-13 Why use SVM?
br/

' Finally, I have something to blog about.
br/

' A user asked, 
br/

' The question I had for you, when you've got a
' few minutes, is whether the decision to use the SVM algorithm stemmed
' from research into the success of various machine learning techniques,
' or whether your research concluded that this would be an effective
' technique for predicition in financial markets.
br/

' Thanks, and I'll be following this project!

br/

' Here is my response:
br/

' JH,
br/

' About my site http://bot4.us,
' my decision to use SVM is based on convenience.
br/

' I've looked at a number of methods/algorithms for generating predictions.
br/

' For each one I collected a set of predictions in the thousands on historical data.
br/

' Then, I'd use Pearson's Correlation to see the correlation between predictions and gains.
br/

' So far, SVM has done best.
br/

' One idea which is worthy of a look is put to use at John F. Ehlers site:
br/

' http://stockspotter.com
br/

' A study of his books at Amazon.com suggests he is using signal processing software to consume a time-series of prices and extrapolating the signal to obtain predictions.
br/

' I took 2 signal EE-processing-classes during me undergrad days at Caltech.
br/

' I think I could get reacquainted with the math again and then start building some software.
br/

' The place for me to start would be here:

br/
a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform" target="w")http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform
br/
a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter" target="w")http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter
br/

' It's probable though I might start having nightmares where I'm an undergrad again and all the final exams are way over my head.

  h4#b2011_0628 2011-06-28 What's in a name?

| My name is Dan.
br/
br/
| I am the Founder of Bot4.us 
br/
br/
| Using Open Source software and significant amount of my time, I created this site from the ground up.
br/
br/
| Currently most of my time is spent on software development.
br/
br/
| Prior to this week, most of my software efforts have been focused on setting up and operating mechanisms which pull data in every 5 minutes and then transform that data into predictions.
br/
br/
| Starting this week I will spend more of my software efforts on the software which you, the end user, will interact with.
br/
br/
| Until I have a better idea of how this site will be useful to you, I aim to keep the User Interface (UI) as simple as possible.
br/
br/
| Currently for the UI I rely on Ruby on Rails and jQuery:
br/
br/
a(href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby+on+rails" target="g")http://www.google.com/search?q=Ruby+on+Rails
br/
br/
a(href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jQuery" target="g")http://www.google.com/search?q=jQuery
br/
br/
| If you have some ideas about how I can enhance, or fix, the site so it is more helpful to you, please send me an e-mail.
br/
br/
| Also I am curious about what you think of the name: "Bot4.us"
br/
br/

| Bot4.us uses machine learning technology (the SVM Algorithm) 
| to issue short-term predictions for both the stock market and the Forex market.
br/
br/
| What should I call the site?
br/
br/
| Most of my friends dislike the name "Bot4.us" which suggests that I should pick a better name.
br/
br/
| I would like to read your opinion, so send me e-mail:
h4 Dan@bot4.us
| If you add "not-spam" to the Subject, I will assume it is HumanMail, not BotMail.
