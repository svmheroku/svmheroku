| Q: How does Bot4.us work?
br/
br/
| A: Bot4.us depends on predictive software I wrote.  I call this software the "DanBot".
| The DanBot depends on an algorithm named SVM which is described in Wikipedia at the URL listed below:
br/
br/
a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="w")http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine
br/
br/
| For many, the above article is a bit dense.
| So I offer a simplistic scenario which may help you understand DanBot behavior.
br/
br/
| First, we assume that past behavior of a stock price can predict future behavior of a stock price better than the act of flipping a coin.
br/
br/
| If you do not believe this assumption, then you should ignore Bot4.us and study trading ideas which you think are valid.
br/
br/
| Next, imagine I have a SimpleBot and I ask it, "If I buy one share of IBM in May and sell it a month later, should I expect a profit?".
br/
br/
| SimpleBot then goes to Yahoo and downloads historical data for IBM from the URL listed below:
br/
br/
a(href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices" target="y")http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices
br/
br/
| SimpleBot loads the data into a database and then analyzes the data via SQL query:
=render :partial => 'faq_ibm_sql'
br/

| SimpleBot sees that during the 20 years between 1990 and 2010 we had a total of 443 days when IBM was traded in May.
br/
br/
| During those 443 days a share of IBM lost an average of $8.2158465 when that share was bought in May and sold 20 trading days later (due to weekends, 20 trading days is about a month).
br/
br/
| SimpleBot issues a prediction,
| "In the future, if you buy a share of IBM in May and sell it a month later you should expect a loss".
br/
br/
| SimpleBot uses 3 types of information to make the prediction:
ul
  li The name of the stock (in this case IBM)
  li A month name (in this case May)
  li 443 days of price-gain history
br/
| The above SimpleBot-scenario gives you a general idea about how the DanBot works.
br/
br/
| SimpleBot differs from DanBot in some significant ways:

ul
  li SimpleBot only gives a prediction
  li DanBot assigns a confidence level to each prediction
  li SimpleBot only looks at IBM
  li DanBot looks at many stocks (and 11 Forex-pairs)
  li SimpleBot looks at one duration of history (20 years)
  li DanBot looks at several durations of history
  li SimpleBot gives a prediction for a stock (IBM) held for 20 trading days
  li DanBot gives predictions for a stock held for 24 hours (or over the weekend)
  li DanBot gives a prediction for a Forex-pair held for 6 hours (or over the weekend)
  li SimpleBot accepts 3 inputs: "IBM", "May", "443 days of price-gain history"
  li DanBot accepts many inputs
  li DanBot is introspective; it throttles back confidence levels when recent predictions trend towards less accuracy
br/
| If you believe that past behavior of a stock can be used to predict future behavior of a stock,
| then the predictions issued by the DanBot may be of interest to you.

' Q: Can the DanBot read charts?
' A: Yes it can if I feed it the numeric attributes which are used by charting software to create the charts.
br/

' The DanBot uses 3 general ideas to give us a prediction:
ul
 li It looks at chart indicators
 li It looks at historical attributes
 li It uses an algorithm named SVM

br/
' Q: Which chart indicators does DanBot use?
br/
br/
' A: Most of them.  One advantage that DanBot has over me is that it can easily "look" at 100 chart indicators.
'    When I look at a chart, I get confused by more than 5 indicators.
'    Here is a chart of GOOG with many indicators:

  img(src="/images/goog_indicators.png" alt="goog_indicators.png")
br/

' Q: Which historical attributes does DanBot use?
br/
br/
' A: It looks at these:
br/
ul
 li Each day, the number of seconds since market open.
 li Hour of the day
 li Day of the week
 li Day of the month
 li Week of the month
 li Month of the year

br/
' Q: Why does DanBot look at historical attributes?
br/
br/
' A: Via a simple OLAP query I discovered that, on Friday afternoons,
' if I buy the SPY ETF one to two hours before market close
' and then sell it one to two hours before market close the next trading day
' (usually a Monday), I usually earn a gain.
br/
br/
' My explanation for this market behavior is that many speculators avoid holding stocks over the weekend.
br/
br/

' Another example of historical attributes as predictive indicators is month of the year.
br/
br/

' Typically the SPY ETF does poorly May through August.
br/
br/

' It usually gains during spring and fall.
br/
br/

' My partial explanation for this market behavior is that many speculators avoid holding stocks over summer vacation while they are away from the market.
br/
br/

' Therefore, I feed historical attributes to the DanBot.
' Maybe other clock or calendar based events affect prices.
' If so, the SVM algorithm has the power to spot them.
br/
br/

' Q: How does the DanBot use the SVM algorithm?
br/
br/
' A: If you are familiar with statistics, I compare the SVM algorithm to Pearson's Correlation calculation.
' I use  Pearson's Correlation calculation to study a set of numeric-attribute-pairs which are best visualized as a scatter-plot.
br/
br/

' For example,
' If I suspect that the average-one-day gain of AAPL depends on the slope of the price-moving-average of AAPL,
' I would use Pearson's Correlation calculation study this possible dependency.

br/
br/
' Also I would plot these two attributes in a scatter plot.

br/
br/
' I'd plot price-moving-average on the horizontal-axis to designate that it is an independent attribute.

br/
br/
' I'd plot one-day-gain on the vertical-axis to signal my hope that it depends on price-moving-average.

br/
br/
' Since Pearson's Correlation calculation can only work with sets of two-attribute-pairs, this technique fails if I want to study the dependence of gain on several types of price-moving-averages.

br/
br/
' SVM is an answer to this problem.

br/
br/
' It allows me to package up several numeric attributes into a "vector" and then help me study how one-day-gain depends on the vector.

br/
br/
' So, when DanBot wants to see a vector so it can predict the amount of one-day-gain for AAPL, I load up the vector with both chart indicators and historical attributes.

br/
br/
' When DanBot sees the vector, it compares it to many thousands of other vectors it has seen in the past where one-day-gain is known.  

br/
br/
' After this comparison is done by SVM, DanBot copies resulting prediction from SVM and goes about the task of displaying the prediction on the website.
