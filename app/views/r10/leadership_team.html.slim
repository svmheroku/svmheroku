br/
| I am Dan Bikle, Founder of RoboLuck.com.
br/
br/

| For RoboLuck.com, I occupy the sole leadership position.
br/
br/

| I graduated from Caltech in 1988 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.
br/
br/

| From 1988 to 2011 I filled a wide variety of technical roles mostly related to both Software Development and IT operations.
br/
br/

| As Founder of RoboLuck.com, my roles are easy to label.
br/
br/
h4 Product Manager

| As Product Manager, I understand the simple desire to predict the future.
br/
br/

| I transform that desire into a UI specification which helps me see both future opportunities and past effectiveness of my technology.
br/
br/

| The UI specification has two major components:

ul
  li How the UI will look
  li How the UI will behave when given inputs from data sources
  li How the UI will behave when given inputs from you the end-user

I use ideas from "Behavior Driven Development" to specify the behavior of RoboLuck.com to the Engineering Manager:

h4 Engineering Manager

| As Engineering Manager, I transform those UI specifications into software which tests both the UI and the back-end technology which feeds data to the UI.
br/
br/

| In addition to these software tests, I build the software which is being tested.
br/
br/

| The software I write has a modular nature.
| And, my initial effort to build each piece is focused on building tests for each piece.  
| After the tests are written, I use their output to help me write my modular software.
br/
br/

| As I build modules, I eventually ask them to work in concert.
br/
br/

| Once this request is apparent, I build more tests which ensure the modules play well together.
br/
br/
| At this point I will often use the behavioral tests written by Dan the Product Manager. 
br/
br/

| Then I write the actual software which choreagraphs the behavior of the modules and implements the site behavior which allows you the end-user to interact with the site.
br/
br/

| This idea of building tests first is often referred to as "Test Driven Development":

h4 Operations Manager

| As Operations Manager I launched the site.
| Then, each day, I ensure the site behaves as specified by the behaviorial tests written by Dan the Product Manager. 
| Additionally I report bugs (and enhancement requests from end-users) to Dan the Product Manager. 
| It is his job to code up behaviorial tests which will indicate success/failure once the bugs are fixed.  
| Then the behaviorial tests are sent to Dan the Engineering Manager who then enhances the software behind the site until the behaviorial tests indicate the bugs are fixed.  

h4 Marketing Manager

| As Marketing Manager I market the site to a vast supply of end-users. 
| I drive traffic to the site and ensure that the site is well known among finance speculators.  

h4 Finance Manager

| As Finance Manager I optimize the flow of investment into the site to ensure that the benefits enjoyed by the investors surpass the both the costs and investements supplied by the investors.
