h4 Leadership Team  
hr/
h4 CEO
| I am Dan Bikle, Founder of RoboLuck.com.
br/
br/
| I occupy the sole leadership position here.
br/
br/

| I graduated from Caltech in 1988 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.
br/
br/

| From 1988 to 2011 I filled a wide variety of technical roles mostly related to both Software Development and IT operations.
br/
br/

| As Founder of RoboLuck.com, my roles are easy to label.
br/
br/
h4 Product Manager

| As Product Manager, I understand the simple desire to predict the future.
br/
br/

| I transform that desire into a UI specification which helps me see both future opportunities and past effectiveness of my technology.
br/
br/

| The UI specification has two major components:

ul
  li How the UI will look
  li How the UI will behave when given inputs from you the end-user

I use ideas from "Behavior Driven Development" to specify the behavior of RoboLuck.com to the Engineering Manager:

h4 Engineering Manager

| As Engineering Manager, I transform those UI specifications into software which tests both the UI and the back-end technology which feeds data to the UI.
br/
br/

| In addition to these software tests, I build the software which is being tested.
br/
br/

| The software I write has a modular nature.
| And, my initial effort to build each piece is focused on building tests for each piece.  
| After the tests are written, I use their output to help me write my modular software.
br/
br/

| As I build modules, I eventually ask them to work in concert.
br/
br/

| Once this request is apparent, I build more tests which ensure the modules play well together.
br/
br/
| At this point I will often use the behavioral tests written by Dan the Product Manager. 
br/
br/

| Then I write the actual software which choreagraphs the behavior of the modules and implements the site behavior which allows you the end-user to interact with the site.
br/
br/

| This idea of building tests first is often referred to as "Test Driven Development":
