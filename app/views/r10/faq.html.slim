| Q: How does RoboLuck.com work?
br/
br/
| A: RoboLuck.com depends on predictive software I wrote.  I call this software the "DanBot".
| The DanBot dpends on an algorithm named SVM which is described in Wikipedia here ->
a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="w")http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine
br/
br/
| For many, the above article is a bit dense.
| So I offer a simplistic scenario which may help you understand DanBot behavior.
br/
br/
| Suppose that your friend asks, "If I buy IBM in July and sell it a month later, should I expect a profit?".
br/
br/
| You don't know so you go to Yahoo and download historical data for IBM from the URL listed below:
br/
br/
a(href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices" target="y")http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices
br/
br/
| You analyze the downloaded data using a spreadsheet.
| You discover that on average (spanning the years 1990 through 2010), IBM share price goes down when it is bought in July and sold a month later.
br/
br/
| Then you issue a prediction, "If you buy IBM in July and sell it a month later you should expect a loss".
br/
br/
| In the above scenario only 3 types of information are used to make the prediction:
ul
  li The name of the stock (in this case IBM)
  li A month name (in this case July)
  li A history duration (in this case the years 1990 through 2010)
br/
| The above scenario gives you a general idea about how the DanBot works.
br/
br/
| If you believe that past behavior of a stock can be used to predict future behavior of a stock,
| then the predictions issued by the DanBot may be of interest to you.
