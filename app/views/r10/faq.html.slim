| Q: How does RoboLuck.com work?
br/
br/
| A: RoboLuck.com depends on predictive software I wrote.  I call this software the "DanBot".
| The DanBot dpends on an algorithm named SVM which is described in Wikipedia here ->

br/
br/
| For many, the above article is a bit dense.
| So I offer a simplistic scenario which may help you understand DanBot behavior.
br/
br/
| First, we assume that past behavior of a stock price can predict future behavior of a stock price better than the act of flipping a coin.
br/
br/
| If you do not believe this assumption, then you should ignore RoboLuck.com and study things which you think are true.
br/
br/
| Next, imagine I have a SimpleBot and I ask it, "If I buy IBM in July and sell it a month later, should I expect a profit?".
br/
br/
| SimpleBot then goes to Yahoo and downloads historical data for IBM from the URL listed below:
br/
br/
a(href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices" target="y")http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices
br/
br/
| SimpleBot analyzes the downloaded data using a spreadsheet.
| SimpleBot sees that on average (spanning the years 1990 through 2010), IBM share price goes down when it is bought in July and sold a month later.
br/
br/
| SimpleBot issues a prediction, "If you buy IBM in July and sell it a month later you should expect a loss".
br/
br/
| SimpleBot uses 3 types of information to make the prediction:
ul
  li The name of the stock (in this case IBM)
  li A month name (in this case July)
  li A history duration (in this case the years 1990 through 2010)
br/
| The above scenario gives you a general idea about how the DanBot works.
br/
br/
| SimpleBot differs from DanBot in some significant ways:

ul
  li SimpleBot only gives a prediction
  li DanBot assigns a confidence level to each prediction
  li SimpleBot only looks at IBM
  li DanBot looks at many stocks (and 11 Forex-pairs)
  li SimpleBot looks at one duration of history (20 years)
  li DanBot looks at several durations of history
  li SimpleBot gives a prediction for a stock (IBM) held for 1 month (when it is bought in July)
  li DanBot gives predictions for a stock held for 24 hours (or over the weekend)
  li DanBot gives a prediction for a Forex-pair held for 6 hours (or over the weekend)
  li SimpleBot accepts 3 inputs: "IBM", "July", "List of prices for years 1990 through 2010"
  li DanBot accepts many inputs
br/
| If you believe that past behavior of a stock can be used to predict future behavior of a stock,
| then the predictions issued by the DanBot may be of interest to you.
