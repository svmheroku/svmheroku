  %h4#b2011_0920 2011-09-20 A Search For Correlation

On September 13, 2001 I gave a presentation at the Bay Area Trading Systems Interest Group:
%br/
%br/
%a(href="http://www.meetup.com/batsig/" target="m")http://www.meetup.com/batsig
%br/
%br/

An enhanced version of that presentation is displayed below.

%h4 Summary

I start off with a discussion about downloading a copy of Oracle RDBMS software
and installing it on a laptop.
%br/
%br/

Next I pick a stock we love or hate and I show how to download many years of CSV data for it from 
Yahoo to a laptop.
%br/
%br/

Then I demonstrate loading that data into an Oracle table using a utility called SQL-Loader.
%br/
%br/

Next I decide on a holding-period which we want to simulate. Probably one week would be a good choice.
%br/
%br/

Then I demonstrate how to create a table from the CSV data which contains useful columns:
%br/
%ul
  %li tkr
  %li date
  %li date1week_later
  %li price1
  %li price2
  %li mvg_avg_4wk_slope
  %li gain1week

Next I demonstrate how to visualize gain1week as a distribution (hint: it will look like a bell curve).
%br/
%br/

Then I demonstrate how to visualize mvg_avg_4wk_slope as a distribution (hint: it will look like a bell curve).
%br/
%br/

Next I demonstrate how to visualize mvg_avg_4wk_slope and gain1week as points in a scatter plot.
%br/
%br/

Next I answer the question, when mvg_avg_4wk_slope, was more than two standard deviations from the mean, how did gain1week usually react? (hint: we will use Pearson's Correlation here)
%br/
%br/

Next I discuss the question, what besides mvg_avg_4wk_slope could we mix with gain1week in a scatter plot?
%br/
%br/

My goal is to find some calculated attribute of stock price which has a large correlation with gain1week (and thus be predictive).

How to Download Oracle:
%br/
%ul
  %li
    %a(href="http://oracle.com" target="o") http://oracle.com
  %li Look for: "Downloads"
  %li Then, Look for: "Database 11g Enterprise"
  %li
    Then, Look for this:
    %br/
    (11.2.0.1.0)
    %br/
    Download Microsoft Windows (32-bit)     File 1, File 2  (2GB)  See All
    %br/
    Download Microsoft Windows (x64)        File 1, File 2  (2GB)  See All
    %br/
    Download Linux x86      File 1, File 2  (2GB)  See All
    %br/
    Download Linux x86-64   File 1, File 2  (2GB)  See All 
    %br/
  %li I prefer Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) so I can drive Oracle SQL scripts with Linux Shell scripts
  %li If you only have windows, try vmware player in windows, Linux (Ubuntu 8.04) in vmware, Oracle in Linux
  %li

I Show the 2 plots of the SPY prices from Yahoo.
%br/
%br/
The first plot is just a simple time series of 4,696 prices.
%br/
%br/
The 2nd plot is a box plot of the data grouped by year.
%br/
%br/
For each year the box plot shows min, max, median, quartiles and outliers.
%br/
%br/

It's obvious that 2011 has the most outliers and they are negative.
%br/
%br/

I would have expected 2008 to have the most outliers but I see none in the box plot.

I use R to visualize the data from the second query.
%br/
%br/

I plot a simple gain-frequency-histogram with a normal distribution overlayed on top.
%br/
%br/
I show two standard deviations from the mean as two blue vertical lines.

    g1wmin = -0.198

%br/
%br/
Interpretation:
%br/
%br/
I see a long tail of negative gains and bias towards positive gains near the mean.
%br/
%br/
Next I plot data from the tails.
%br/
%br/


%pre.rlanguage
  :preserve
    # gdist2.r
    # I use this file to read gdist2.csv which was created from gdist.csv
    # The data is a frequency count which I intend to display as a histogram.
    
    # I build gdist2.csv by hand from gdist.csv
    gdist2 = read.csv("gdist2.csv")
    
    # Define the .png file which will hold the output:
    png("gdist2.png",width = 800, height = 800)
    
    # Plot the R and L tails:
    plot(gdist2$G1WR2,gdist2$GCOUNT,type="h",lwd=4,col="black",xlim=c(-0.2,0.2),
      xlab="Left and Right Tails of Rounded Normalized 1 Week Gains",ylab="Frequency Count")
    grid(col="black")
    
    # I pulled these values from my Oracle rpt:
    g1wmin = -0.198
    g1wmax = 0.194
    g1wsd = 0.02515
    g1wmean = 0.00171
    
    # Show Mean and 2 stddevs from mean as vertical lines:
    abline(v = g1wmean, col="blue",lwd=2)
    abline(v = g1wmean-2*g1wsd, col="blue",lwd=2)
    abline(v = g1wmean+2*g1wsd, col="blue",lwd=2)
    
    dev.off()
%br/
%br/

%img(src="/images/gdist2.png")

%br/
%br/
Again,
I see a long tail of negative gains and bias towards positive gains near the mean.
%br/
%br/
I show two standard deviations from the mean as two blue vertical lines.
%br/
%br/
The blue vertical line in the middle is at the mean.
%br/
%br/
Before I started this exercise I assumed that the histogram of gains would resemble a bell curve.
%br/
%br/
I was wrong; instead it looks like a narrow triangle with a long tail on the left.
%br/
%br/


%h4 Next, I demonstrate how to visualize mvg_avg_4wk_slope as a distribution

As before I collect slope frequencies using a SQL script.

As before, I see a long tail left of the mean.
%br/
%br/
Unlike the gain frequencies, it seems that the mean is further to the right; it is more positive.
%br/

I used R to plot the data:

%pre.rlanguage
  :preserve
    # masr3.r
    # I use this file to read masr3.csv which was created from ma_gdist.sql
    # The data is a frequency count which I intend to display as a histogram.
    
    # I build masr3.csv by hand from preso.txt
    masr3 = read.csv("masr3.csv")
    
    # Define the .png file which will hold the output:
    png("masr3.png",width = 800, height = 800)
    
    # Plot the R and L tails:
    plot(masr3$MASR3,masr3$GCOUNT,type="h",lwd=4,col="black",xlim=c(-0.025,0.025),
      xlab="Rounded Normalized Moving Average Slopes",ylab="Frequency Count")
    grid(col="black")
    
    # I pulled these values from my Oracle rpt:
    masr3min = -0.0209
    masr3max = 0.00901
    masr3sd = 0.00237
    masr3mean = 0.000223
    
    # Show Mean and 2 stddevs from mean as vertical lines:
    abline(v = masr3mean, col="blue",lwd=2)
    abline(v = masr3mean-2*masr3sd, col="blue",lwd=2)
    abline(v = masr3mean+2*masr3sd, col="blue",lwd=2)
    
    
    # Now overlay another plot:

This histogram  resembles the histogram of gains.
It looks like a narrow triangle with a long tail on the left.
%br/

%h4
  Next I answer the question, 
  when mvg_avg_4wk_slope, was more than two standard deviations from the mean, 
  how did gain1week usually react? 

SQL is well suited to answer this question as demonstrated by the script below:

The last query shows a significant negative correlation between negative moving average slopes and resulting gains.
%br/
%br/
In plain English it could be stated like this:
%br/
%br/

When the slope of the moving average is abnormally negative 
(more than two standard deviations to the left of the mean), that is a bullish indicator for SPY.

%br/
%br/

In this situation we should expect a return of 1.4% / week.

%br/
Since 1998 this opportunity appeared 134 times and offered a return of 187% (assuming a constant sized bet).

Next, I show how to visualize the negative correlation between moving average slope and gain as a scatter plot.
%br/
%br/
I use SQL and then R to create a plot:
%br/

%pre.sql
  :preserve
    --
    -- masg.sql
    --
    
    -- I use this script to create 2 columns:
    -- Mvg Avg Slope (mas)
    -- Gain 1 week (g1w)
    SET COLSEP ","
    
    SELECT
    mvg_avg_slope mas
    ,gain1week    g1w
    FROM batsig
    WHERE ABS(mvg_avg_slope)>= 0.004
    ORDER BY mvg_avg_slope;
    
    exit

%br/
%br/

%pre.rlanguage
  :preserve
    # masg004.r
    # I use this script to read masg004.csv which was created from masg.sql
    
    masg004 = read.csv("masg004.csv")
    
    # Define the .png file which will hold the output:
    png("masg004.png",width = 800, height = 800)
    
    plot(masg004$MAS,masg004$G1W,pch=20,col="black",xlim=c(-0.025,0.025),
      xlab="Scatter Plot: Mvg. Avg. Slope vs. Gain 1 Wk.",ylab="Gain 1 Wk.")
    grid(col="black")
    
    abline(v = 0.004, col="red",lwd=1)
    abline(v = -0.004, col="red",lwd=1)
    
    abline(v = 0.0045, col="green",lwd=1)
    abline(v = -0.0045, col="green",lwd=1)
    
    abline(v = 0.005, col="blue",lwd=1)
    abline(v = -0.005, col="blue",lwd=1)
    
    dev.off()


%img(src="/images/masg004.png")
%br/
%br/
The red vertical line in the above plot corresponds to this predicate:
%br/
%br/
SELECT data FROM batsig  WHERE ABS(mvg_avg_slope)>= 0.004

%br/
%br/
The green vertical line corresponds to this predicate:
%br/
%br/
SELECT data FROM batsig  WHERE ABS(mvg_avg_slope)>= 0.0045

%br/
%br/
The blue vertical line corresponds to this predicate:
%br/
%br/
SELECT data FROM batsig  WHERE ABS(mvg_avg_slope)>= 0.005
%br/
%br/
It is not obvious from the scatter plot but inspection of the SQL output from 
corr_spy.sql reveals that this predicate gives me the best results:
%br/
%br/
SELECT data FROM batsig  WHERE ABS(mvg_avg_slope)>= 0.005
%br/
%br/
Inspection of the plot, however, does reveal that if I draw a vertical line at -0.01 and slowly move it to the left, the proportion of dots above the 0.0 line increases.
%br/
%br/
I interpret this to mean that as moving average slope becomes more negative, the negative correlation between that slope and gain becomes stronger.
%br/
%br/

%h4 Next I discuss the question, what besides mvg_avg_4wk_slope could we mix with gain1week in a scatter plot?

Answer: More tkrs!
%br/
%br/
I obtained data for more tkrs by duplicating my efforts to fill ystk_stage with prices from SPY.
%br/
%br/
I then filled a table named ystk and wrote a SQL script to query it:
%br/

The above query gives me a list of tkrs which exhibit negative correlation between moving average slope and 1 week gain.
%br/
%br/
For example I see that GOOG, the tkr for Google, has a correlation of -0.532438
%br/
%br/
Between 2006-02-07 and 2011-08-22 I had 51 opportunities to trade GOOG on this signal.
%br/
%br/
The average one week gain of these 51 opportunities was 1.2%
%br/
%br/

%h4 How do I trade using this idea?

Using moving average slope to generate buy or sell signals depends on a simple idea.
%br/
%br/
Every day I download tkr prices from Yahoo into a table.
%br/
%br/
I use SQL to inspect the slope of the moving average of tkrs which exhibited negative correlation in the past.
%br/
%br/
So that is it.  In the evening after Yahoo has collected closing prices, I download prices and then I run a SQL script.
%br/
%br/
I offer more discussion before I display the download script and the SQL script.
%br/
%br/

If the slope of the moving average for any tkr is more than two standard deviations from the mean, I interpret that as a signal to buy or sell.

%br/
%br/
One subtle point is that negative correlation usually occurs when moving average slope is negative.

%br/
%br/
Using GOOG as an example again, it appears that it only exhibits strong negative correlation when it has an abnormally negative moving average slope.
%br/
%br/
I see no evidence that GOOG exhibits strong negative correlation when it has an abnormally positive moving average slope.
%br/
%br/
Some tkrs do, however, exhibit strong negative correlation when moving average slope is abnormally positive.
%br/
%br/
The most commonly known tkr which exhibits this behavior is AXP, the tkr for American Express.
%br/
%br/
In fact, I see only one tkr which exhibits strong negative correlation for both negative and positive slopes.
%br/
%br/
That tkr is EGO which is the tkr for Eldorado Gold Corporation.
%br/
%br/
With that discussion behind us, I now display the script to download prices for tkrs which exhibit strong negative correlation:
