The DanBot uses 3 general ideas to give us a prediction:
  - It looks at chart indicators
  - It looks at historical attributes
  - It uses an algorithm named SVM

Q: Which chart indicators does DanBot use?
A: Most of them.  One advantage that DanBot has over me is that it can easily "look" at 100 chart indicators.
   When I look at a chart, it get confusing to me after it contains 5 indicators.
   Here is a chart of IBM with many indicators:

Q: Which historical attributes does DanBot use?
A: It looks at these:
  - Each day, the number of seconds since market open.
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the week
  - Day of the month
  - Week of the month
  - Month of the year

Q: Why does DanBot look at historical attributes?
A: Via a simple OLAP query I discovered that, on Fridays,
if I buy the SPY ETF one to two hours before market close
and then sell it one to two hours before market close the next trading day
(usually a Monday), I usually earn a gain.
My explanation for this market behavior is that many investors do not want to hold stocks over the weekend.
