The DanBot uses 3 general ideas to give us a prediction:
  - It looks at chart indicators
  - It looks at historical attributes
  - It uses an algorithm named SVM

Q: Which chart indicators does DanBot use?
A: Most of them.  One advantage that DanBot has over me is that it can easily "look" at 100 chart indicators.
   When I look at a chart, it get confusing to me after it contains 5 indicators.
