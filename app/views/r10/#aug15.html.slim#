' The DanBot is designed to issue a set of predictions every 5 minutes.
' I assign a set of time series labels to each prediction.
' The names of the labels are listed below:
ul
  li Hour0
  li Hour1
  li Hour6
  li Hour24

' Both Forex and US Stock predictions use the labels Hour0 and Hour1.
' Forex predictions use the label Hour6.
' US Stock predictions use the label Hour24.

' Each label helps me track the state of a prediction.
