  h4#b2011_0815 2011-08-15 A discussion about 1 hour gain

' The DanBot is designed to issue a set of predictions every 5 minutes.
' I assign a set of time series labels to each prediction.
' I use these labels to help me manage my reaction to each prediction.
' The names of the labels are listed below:
ul
  li Hour0 (used to track both Forex and US Stock predictions)
  li Hour1 (used to track both Forex and US Stock predictions)
  li Hour6 (used to track Forex predictions)
  li Hour24 (used to track US Stock predictions)

' Each label helps me track the state of a prediction as time passes.

' For example at Hour1, a prediction is one hour old.

' If I am looking at a stock prediction, at Hour1 I have two pieces of information about the prediction.

' I know the score which was issued at Hour0 and I know the gain of the stock between Hour0 and Hour1.
