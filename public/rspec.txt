Use RSpec to Learn Ruby

Ruby is a popular language. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an effective method for delivering high quality software. RSpec is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Ruby which helps you apply BDD to your Ruby programming efforts. In this session I teach you Ruby development via RSpec. It is an effective approach to teaching Ruby to the Newby. Besides syntax, a Ruby developer needs to know about a variety of ideas, sites, and tools to become effective: OOP, mixing software modules, rdoc.info, rubygems.org, github.com, editors, IDEs, ruby debugger, IRB. When I teach you to use RSpec to both learn and then drive the development of Ruby software, you will be exposed to most things used by professional Ruby developers. After you learn enough RSpec and Ruby to build and deploy a small software project to do something simple like scrape a website, the next logical step would be to use RSpec to drive your learning of Ruby on Rails. That topic will be covered in another session.

Summary:

Get a development laptop:
  - My opinion:
    - Avoid windows
    - Avoid Mac (unless you do iOS development)
  - costco.com
  - 90 day return policy (I think)
  - HP g6x Laptop $499
  - Processor & Memory:
    Intel® Core™ i3-370M Processor at 2.4Ghz
    6GB DDR3 SDRAM (2 DIMM)
    500GB (7200 RPM) SATA Hard Drive
  - Boot windows
  - Study this:
    - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
  - Get ubuntu 11.04 64b cdrom:
    - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
    - Avoid:
      - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer
    - Instead:
      - click wubi.exe on cdrom
    - pick the largest partition which ubuntu will give you:
      - 30gb I think
      - I wish it were bigger
    - you want to end up with dual boot laptop
  - If you brick the laptop, return it for refund:
    - google: what is costco return policy for computers?

Install ruby 1.9.2 in your home-dir:
  - google: How I install ruby 1.9.2 on ubuntu using RVM?
  - Install RVM:

      - curl -sk https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm > rvm.bash
      - /bin/bash rvm.bash
  - Edit .bash_profile (I prefer .bashrc and then call .bashrc in .bash_profile)
    - [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
  - google: What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?
  - Use RVM to install Ruby 1.9.2:
    - google: SSL certificate problem in RVM
    - create ~/.curlrc and put -k in it (or install CA cert for curl)
